# Crowbar
A quick and dirty spigot plugin to lock the server when crucial plugins are not enabled.

It only keeps players from joining, it will not kick any players. 
Players on the server's whitelist will be allowed to join regardless, and will be sent a warning message upon join.

Like I said, it's quick and dirty, I coded it in 30 minutes and there's no love and care put into it. 
It's just a quick fix for an uncommon problem.

If anyone cares about this more than I do, and want specific features added, let me know.
